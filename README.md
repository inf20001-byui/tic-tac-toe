# Overview

I wrote this application in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) to learn the basic syntax and functionality of the lanuage.  

It is a game of tic-tac-toe for two players where each player takes turns
placing their mark on the gameboard.  You win by putting three of your game 
pieces in a row, column, or diagonal.

The main game code is located in tic-tac-toe/main.rs
The Cargo.toml file contains dependencies needed for the game to execute
* To run the game you need to perform "cargo build" and "cargo run" in the tic-tac-toe directory.
